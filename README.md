# EDG-380PBoat_Combat

Boat combat is a multiplayer mobile boat action game. This game was created to expand our skills with networking and mobile development. We used Photon for networking and Unity for development.

This was created in conjunction with Mitko Ivanov for EDG-380 at Champlain College in Montreal, QC under the gudance of Ramy Dagshtani. This projects scope was completely self imposed and our milestones were of our own creation.
